# ROS Tax Residency Certificate Scraper

This script takes a list of clients managed by a Tax Agent on Revenue's Online Service ("ROS") and scrapes the site for each company's latest tax residency certificate.

The program will also print a list of companies not considered to be Irish tax resident per ROS's records.

If you have a fast and stable internet connection this program can be sped up by reducing the time delays between each step.

The program can be modified to run a number of similar tasks on ROS such as downloading the latest CT1 returns, self-assessment letters, etc.
